/* The simulation's own trigonometry.
 *
 * Lockstep needs every machine to reach the same state from the same
 * orders. IEEE 754 pins + - * / and sqrt to one answer, so those agree
 * everywhere, but it says nothing about a sine. Each platform's libm
 * rounds its own way and the difference survives into a different cell
 * after enough ticks. See docs/notes/2026-09-14-float-determinism.md.
 *
 * These are built from pinned double constants and the four pinned
 * operations alone, so the answer is the same on every platform by
 * construction. Anything that writes simulation state calls these.
 * Drawing may call libm.
 *
 * The answer is the correctly rounded float for any angle under about
 * 8e6, and within a few last places past that, so gameplay is
 * unchanged. An angle of 1e8 or more is refused rather than guessed. */
